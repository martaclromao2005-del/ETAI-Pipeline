# Baseline Predictive Pipeline -- ETAI
# Marta Romão 2023-1834

## Introduction

The task: predict two-year recidivism using ProPublica's COMPAS
dataset -- the data behind a real 2016 investigation into a risk-
assessment algorithm actually used by US courts to help inform bail and sentencing decisions. 
See `data/README.md` for the full problem description and a complete data dictionary before you start.

It has some **deliberately weak spots**. Part of your work this
semester is finding them and making them better -- see the pipeline progress table below, which tracks what changes and why as the weeks
go on.

## Pipeline progress

This table is updated after each practical class, so you can always see what changed in the pipeline and why -- it's a running log, not a fixed syllabus.

| Week | Practical class focus | Added to the pipeline |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 2 | Introduction & baseline pipeline | Initial version: project structure, a single naive train/test split (no cross-validation), minimal preprocessing (drop rows with missing values, one-hot encode categoricals), logistic regression baseline, a first (deliberately simple) fairness check comparing our model's and COMPAS's own false-positive rate by race, train-vs-test accuracy reporting (to start spotting overfitting), and each run's full report saved automatically to `results/` |

## week 2

*Logistic Regression*
  Train accuracy: 0.679
  Test accuracy:  0.678
  Gap (train - test): +0.001

Train and test accuracy are nearly identical 0.679 and 0.678 having a gap realy near 0 ,
showing the model generalizes well with no overfitting.

*Decision Tree*
  Train accuracy: 0.829
  Test accuracy:  0.633
  Gap (train - test): +0.196

Train accuracy 0.829 is much higher than test accuracy 0.633 having a gap of +0.196 a clear sign of overfitting. 
The tree memorized the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns.

**Overall
Logistic regression is the more reliable model here. Although its training accuracy is lower, it performs consistently on unseen data. 
The decision tree looks stronger on paper , but that advantage doesn't hold on test data, making it less trustworthy for real predictions.

## week 3
EDA- ver missing values
  - ver valores que não fazem sentido (?, -)
  - ver duplicados

Preprocessing - standardizar nome das variaveis
              - mudar data types
              - remover valores que não fazem sentidos, extremos

*Logistic Tree*
Train accuracy: 0.676
Test accuracy:  0.657
Gap (train - test): +0.019


*Decision Tree*
Train accuracy: 0.679
Test accuracy:  0.678
Gap (train - test): +0.001



## Environment setup

**Windows**
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```powershell
venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py
```

## Running the pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```
##
This loads `config.yaml`, loads and preprocesses the data, trains the model, and prints:
- **train accuracy and test accuracy, side by side.** Comparing the two is how you catch overfitting: if the model looks much better on the data it was trained on than on data it's never seen, it has memorised rather than learned something that generalises. 
- a classification report on the test set
- a false-positive-rate-by-race comparison between our model and
  COMPAS's own score

All of this is also saved to a timestamped file in `results/` (e.g.`results/run_20260916_143012.txt`), so it doesn't just scroll past in your terminal -- open it later, or change something in `config.yaml` (like the model type) and compare the new file to the last one.
`results/` is created automatically the first time you run the
pipeline, and isn't tracked in git (see `.gitignore`) since it's
generated output, not source.
